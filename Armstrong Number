Question:
You are given a number. Your task is to check if this number is an Armstrong number.

What is an armstrong number?
An Armstrong number  is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits, each raised to the power of the number of digits.

User Task:
This is a function problem. You don't have to take any input. You are required to complete the function isArmstrong() that takes an integer N as a parameter and returns True if the number is an Armstrong number, otherwise returns False.

Input:
First line will contain an Integer N.
Output:
Return True if the number is Armstrong, otherwise return False.


Solution:
def length(N):
    count = 0
    while N > 0:
        N //= 10
        count += 1
    return count

def isArmstrong(N):
    power = length(N)
    sum_of_powers = 0
    temp = N

    while temp > 0:
        digit = temp % 10
        sum_of_powers += digit ** power
        temp //= 10

    return N == sum_of_powers
